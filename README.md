# AP_Task2

**This project was built by Daniel Lifshitz and Adira Weiss.**

**In this project we find the type of a given vector using the KNN algorithm and a file of classified vectors.**

**The Files:**

**CalcDist.h/cpp:**
 With those files we calculate all the distances from the vector for the KNN algorithm.

**KNN.h/cpp:**
 With those files we implement the KNN algorithm in O(n*log(n)) time and O(n) space. (n is the amount of vectors).

**Point.h/cpp:**
 With those files we merge both the vectors and types together and implements the getters and setters.

**PointReader.h/cpp:**
 With those files we read the .csv file and create all the classified points.

**SafetyChecks.h/cpp:**
 With those files we implement all the edge cases tests and checking for wrong input.

**main.cpp:**
 With that file we run the entire program and printing the type of the vector inputted.
