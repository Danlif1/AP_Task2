This project should work by getting a file of classified irises (or points)
that holds 5 types of identification (width, sepal Length, sepal Width, petal Length and type)
And it should return for a given file of unclassified irises (or points)
that holds 4 types of identification (width, sepal Length, sepal Width and petal Length)
a file that holds the classificiation for the irises using the KNN algorithim.
